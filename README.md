# NHL-API-Games-to-CSV
This project uses the NHL API in a few ways in order to ultimately fetch game logs for active NHL player careers. Firstly, a for loop runs for each team tricode like (ANA for Anaheim), fetching the the current team rosters. It accesses the forwards, defense, and goalies. Combining forwards/defense into a skater's list, and keeping goalies as it's own list. Within those lists, it grabs the playerId, which is then used to access the individual player API, which returns seasonTotals, where you can get each season the player has played in the NHL. Once the player_id and respective seasons in the NHL are had, it's now possible to access each of their game_logs, which are fetched from the API, added to a data list, and at the final stop are imputted into a CSV file dependent on position.
